Extreme Heat often results in the highest number of annual deaths among all weather-related hazards. Never leave a child, adult, or animal alone inside a vehicle on a warm day.

Creative New Mexico Blog Reader,"March 29, 2020breaking news! Specifically to Arts Grantees in New Mexico; We wanted to get this information out to you as soon as possible. Per the recently passed $2 trillion dollar relief bill the National Endowment for the Arts will receive $75M to distribute to arts organizations in need. The Arts Endowment will award funds to nonprofit arts organizations across the country to help these entities survive the forced closure of their operations in response to the spread of COVID-19. As stated in the legislation, the $75 million is intended to assist nonprofit arts organizations to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally. The legislation allows funds to be used for general operating expenses, a departure from the Arts Endowments requirement of supporting project-based funding and an acknowledgment of the dire situation facing the arts community. In addition, arts organizations do not have to provide matching funds to receive their grant. As regards to the distribution of the funds, the standard distinction remains of 40 percent awarded to state and regional arts organizations and 60 percent to be awarded by the Arts Endowment directly to applicant organizations. Details regarding timing and applications are being developed and will be announced as soon as they are available. Please check arts.gov in the coming days for more information about direct funds from the National Endowment for the Arts. There is more to this post.

Gourmet Coffee Brewing,"The gourmet coffee brewing process is not difficult. Anyone can do it by following the simple directions I’m going to share with you. First ensure that the coffee origins, harvesting time, roasting and packaging are optimized. This is critical stage and will determine whether you get a perfectly blended coffee or one that pretty much tastes like warmed over dish water. Here are some general rules to follow as it applies to brewing a great gourmet cup of coffee. Ensure that you’re getting the freshest coffee beans direct from the roasters. This can be done by asking them to deliver your coffee beans right after roasting. No sitting around waiting for the bulk shipments for you. Some roasters provide overnight deliver service for a small charge. Most online coffee clubs already have this service in place. Okay, use only coffee beans and not ground ones. Grind the beans yourself and grind them as close to the brewing time as you can. Be sure that the beans are ground to the right size. A bean ground to finely gives it a bitter taste. Ground to coarse and it will taste flat. Use the right coffee maker, be it a coffee plunger pot, flat drip or cone drip filter type. This will greatly affect the end result of the brew. Water temperature is vital and should be maintained between one hundred ninety five and two hundred degrees Fahrenheit. This will give optimal extraction. Do not use cold water as it will result in flat coffee. Now, warm your coffee mug so it helps maintain the coffee’s temperature for as long as possible. Remember this: brewed coffee tastes it’s best the moment is is brewed. Finally. Never never reuse your coffee grounds. If you reuse them you’re going to get a coffee with such a bitter taste that I guarantee you will never do it again. Now follow this guide and enjoy your best cup of coffee ever.",000,1, ,B07DBNY3F5

Boom Bloom was created in the laboratory of a mad scientist! After using his mutation goo to change deadwood into evil creatures, Dr. Krankcase began experimenting with live plants!

Voltage Divider,"You have a 3300 ohms resistor installed at ground and a supply voltage of 5 volts. To get a desired voltage of 3.3 volts, you need a 1700 ohm resistor. That would be a 1.7 kilo ohm resistor. The minimum power rating of the resistor in this circuit is 0.0017 watts. I would suggest doubling that to 0.0034 watts at the least. The maximum current that will flow through this resistor is 0.001 amps. However, you should only be using a voltage divider to step down a signal line, not for delivering power to a load.

Poison Dart Frog,"You are listening to information about the medicinal use of Poison Dart Frogs. Chemicals extracted from the skin of Epipedobates tricolor may be shown to have medicinal value. Scientists use this poison to make a painkiller. One such chemical is a painkiller 200 times as potent as morphine, called epibatidine; however, the therapeutic dose is very close to the fatal dose. A derivative ABT-594 developed by Abbott Laboratories, called Tebanicline got as far as Phase II trials in humans, but was dropped from further development due to unacceptable incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. Secretions from dendrobatids are also showing promise as muscle relaxants, heart stimulants and appetite suppressants. The most poisonous of these frogs, the golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis), has enough toxin on average to kill ten to twenty men or about ten thousand mice. Most other dendrobatids, while colorful and toxic enough to discourage predation, pose far less risk to humans or other large animals",000,1, ,B081PL1MQV

Poison Dart Frog,"You are listening to information about the habitat of Poison Dart Frogs' Taxicity. Many poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins such as allopumiliotoxin 267A, batrachotoxin, epibatidine, histrionicotoxin, and pumiliotoxin 251D through their skin. Alkaloids in the skin glands of poison frogs serve as a chemical defense against predation, and they are therefore able to be active alongside potential predators during the day. About 28 structural classes of alkaloids are known in poison frogs. The most toxic of poison dart frog species is Phyllobates terribilis. It is argued that dart frogs do not synthesize their poisons, but sequester the chemicals from arthropod prey items, such as ants, centipedes and mites – the diet-toxicity hypothesis. Because of this, captive-bred animals do not possess significant levels of toxins as they are reared on diets that do not contain the alkaloids sequestered by wild populations. In fact, new studies suggest that the maternal frogs of some species lay unfertilized eggs, which are laced with trace amounts of alkaloids, to feed the tadpoles. This behavior shows that the poisons are introduced from a very young age. Nonetheless, the captive-bred frogs retain the ability to accumulate alkaloids when they are once again provided an alkaloid-containing diet. Despite the toxins used by some poison dart frogs, some predators have developed the ability to withstand them. One is the snake Erythrolamprus epinephalus, which has developed immunity to the poison.",000,1,Open Poison Dart Frog,B081PL1MQV

The Gettysburg Address,"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow, this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

Random Business Analyst Tips,Welcome to Business Analyst Tips. Here is your random Business Analyst Tip. Have a Strong Sense of Project Management. Business analysts are proactive and dependency aware. They manage themselves to commitments and deadlines. A business analyst also get stakeholders involved at the right times and in the right ways and works hard to keep everything moving. They keep a close eye on value and feasibility and guide their stakeholders toward a set of requirements that can actually get implemented. Would you like to hear another Business Analyst Tip?.,000,1,Yes,B07Q12H3P7
Random Business Analyst Tips,"Okay. Here is another Business Analyst Tip. Help to Minimize Scope Creep. As business analysts, we know that stakeholders may request additional requirements during the course of the project. A new requirement is accepted or rejected depending on whether it can be directly linked to the business need. However, business analysts need to remember that the project manager aims to minimize new additions to the project scope (scope creep) that will require the adjustment of the project budget and schedule. In most cases, stakeholders are not willing to incur the increased cost or time required for inclusion of new requirements. Would you like to hear another Business Analyst Tip?.",000,1,Yes,B07Q12H3P7
Random Business Analyst Tips,"Okay. Here is another Business Analyst Tip. Transition Requirements. Transition Requirements can sometimes be implemented as Post-GO-LIVE Tasks. Business analysts also capture transition requirements i.e. the required training of users. For a business analyst, a project is complete when all the categories of requirements i.e. transition requirements have been implemented. However, what is sometimes experienced is the project manager wishes to separate the implementation of transition requirements from the project scope and treat transition requirements as post-GO-Live tasks. This is usually the case when the project has a non-negotiable constraint on the GO-Live date. Would you like to hear another Business Analyst Tip?.",000,1,Yes,B07Q12H3P7
Random Business Analyst Tips,"Okay. Here is another Business Analyst Tip. Prioritization of Requirements. Prioritization of requirements is a standard task that we carry out as business analysts under requirements analysis. However, it is common to reach a roadblock where stakeholders wish to classify all their requirements as a high priority. This is usually due to the fear that non-high priority requirements will be excluded in the project scope. With this in mind, it is recommended that prioritization of requirements is done with the involvement of the project manager to assist in the management of your stakeholders.Would you like to hear another Business Analyst Tip?.",000,1,A lot,B07Q12H3P7

Fly Wheel,"Hello. My name is Kay and I am the author of the book, A Curious Boy Named Jeff. Hope you enjoy this story!Meet Jeff. He was a very curious boy. He wanted to know how things worked and why. He would ask lots of questions. Asking questions is a great way to learn. Jeff enjoyed learning new lessons in school, especially about math and science. He paid attention and listened carefully to his teachers. Jeff also liked reading. He read many kinds of books. His favorite kind was science fiction. Reading gives you tons of knowledge and helps grow your imagination. When Jeff was not reading, he spent time experimenting. Experimenting means trying new ways of doing things. Jeff's experiments helped him to create his own machines like a gate opener and an alarm for his bedroom. Jeff loved spending time with his grandfather the most. He would watch his grandfather work on his ranch and help him out too. Jeff learned how to fix broken tools and build a house from scratch. Observing and helping others helps you learn new skills. As Jeff got older, he became curious about the computer and internet. The internet helps people find information on anything and everything. Jeff learned that he could use them to help people and started his own company called Amazon. Amazon helps people buy and sell anything using the computer and internet. You can buy toys, books and even groceries. Jeff wants to keep helping people and everyday he is trying to find ways to do that. He keeps asking questions, observes the people around him, and continues to read and experiment. If you do the same, maybe one day you will discover something new and can change the world too. Thank you for listening. Would you like to try learning some math? For math addition say topic one. For math subtraction, say topic two.",000,1,topic two,B08BG7LCRQ

Email Marketing,"Welcome to email marketing facts! Let's start. We don't advise that you send an email that's a single image. Emails that are a single image generate high spam complaints and high bounce rates, and inbox providers like Outlook will not automatically display an image. A milestone email is a behavior-based email that you would send to an existing customer. The purpose is to remind your customer of the unique value they're getting from you, increase the likelihood they will continue to use your product, and create a community of users. Want to hear some more?",000,1,Yes,B07XT97YBD
Email Marketing,"Companies that have email nurture campaigns generate 50 percent more leads, and those leads are generated at a 33 percent lower cost over companies that don't nurture leads with email campaigns. The best days to send a marketing email are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. But if everyone else is sending on those days, it is worth testing Monday and Friday for your brand. Want some more?",000,1,Yes,B07XT97YBD
Email Marketing,"Send frequency for email depends on your message and your reason for sending. Newsletters perform best when they are spread out by several weeks, but an abandoned cart email should go out within 48 hours. Test your send frequency for best results. Make sure your promotional emails are mobile friendly. More than half of all promotional emails are opened on mobile devices. Want to hear some more?",000,1,Yes,B07XT97YBD
Email Marketing,The ideal width for an email is 600 pixels. The maximum width is 960 pixels. Here are some email font size suggestions: headlines should be at least 30 pixels. Body copy should be at least 16 pixels. Your smallest font size should be 13 pixels. Ready to hear some more?,000,1,A lot,B07XT97YBD
Email Marketing,"Here's a fact: Depending on your industry, average email open rates range from 15 to 20 percent. You can improve open rates by segmenting your list and sending targeted, relevant offers. Want to hear some more?",000,1,Yes,B07XT97YBD
Email Marketing,"For a header image, go for 600 pixels wide and no more than 250 pixels high. Your top 300 pixels are precious! According to Marketing Sherpa, more than 90 percent of consumers want to receive promotional emails, but only 15 percent of those buyers want to receive promotional emails every day. Most buyers prefer to receive promotional emails at least once a month. Want some more?",000,1,Yes,B07XT97YBD
Email Marketing,"Email can be measured by click through rate, conversion rate, open rate and return on investment. Most marketers focus on the click through rate as a measure of interest and engagement. Emails with high clickthrough rates tend to have fewer call-to-action links. A good rule of thumb is one large call-to-action button link in the center of your email. Want to hear some more?",000,1,Yes,B07XT97YBD

African species are largely hunted as bushmeat, but there also seems to be some regional use of their scales and other body parts in folk medicines and cultural traditions and rituals. In China and Vietnam (the primary sources of demand for pangolins), the flesh of both adult and fetuses is considered a delicacy and some mistakenly believe they will be blessed with health benefits if they eat it. Their scales, blood, and other body parts are also widely used in traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) and ‘health tonics’. There is mounting concern that African pangolins will increasingly be targeted to supply the burgeoning Far East demand for these animals, as Asian species’ populations continue to plummet toward extinction. In fact, recent events suggest this may already be happening.",000,1,Open Pangolin Facts,B07KW6DTFV
Pangolin Facts,"Here's your pangolin fact: The Chinese and the Sunda pangolins are the most endangered of all eight species. In the case of the latter, their numbers began to decline quite rapidly around 1990 and the population has been halved over just the last 15 years. The IUCN reports that Chinese pangolins have also been greatly reduced over this time period. Despite being protected by CITES, poaching is decimating these (and other) species.",000,1,these,B07KW6DTFV

Polish cities,"Kraków, is the second largest and one of the oldest cities in Poland. Situated on the Vistula River in the Lesser Poland region, the city dates back to the 7th century. Kraków was the official capital of Poland until 1596 and has traditionally been one of the leading centres of Polish academic, economic, cultural and artistic life. Cited as one of Europe's most beautiful cities, its Old Town was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city has grown from a Stone Age settlement to Poland's second most important city. It began as a hamlet on Wawel Hill and was already being reported as a busy trading centre of Slavonic Europe in 965. With the establishment of new universities and cultural venues at the emergence of the Second Polish Republic in 1918 and throughout the 20th century, Kraków reaffirmed its role as a major national academic and artistic centre. The city has a population of about 770,000, with approximately 8 million additional people living within a 100 km (62 mi) radius of its main square.

Polish cities,"Lublin is the ninth largest city in Poland and the second largest city of Lesser Poland. It is the capital and the center of Lublin Voivodeship with a population of 349,103. Lublin is the largest Polish city east of the Vistula River and is approximately 170 kilometres (106 miles) to the southeast of Warsaw by road. One of the events that greatly contributed to the city's development was the Polish-Lithuanian Union of Krewo in 1385. Lublin thrived as a centre of trade and commerce due to its strategic location on the route between Vilnius and Kraków; the inhabitants had the privilege of free trade in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Lublin Parliament session of 1569 led to the creation of a real union between the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, thus creating the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Lublin witnessed the early stages of Reformation in the 16th century. A Calvinist congregation was founded and groups of radical Arians appeared in the city, making it an important global centre of Arianism. At the turn of the centuries, Lublin was recognized for hosting a number of outstanding poets, writers and historians of the epoch Come back tomorrow to play the experience again.",000,1,outstanding,B07L2C6CDZ

Brew Coffee Without Coffee Maker,"Automatic coffee makers consume a huge amount of energy each time they go through a brewing cycle. Any appliance that heats up in it’s process gobbles up a lot of energy. If you have a large brewer and you only need to drink one or two cups of coffee, you should consider making it without using your brewer. Knowing how to make coffee without using your coffee machine can help you a lot especially if there are power outages. What is even better about this, is that you can tweak the flavor to suit your preferences. Here are some simple steps to follow to make your next cup of coffee without using a coffee maker. Step one: Purchase your favorite coffee grounds. You can use the one you have been using with your brewer. Make sure that your coffee beans have been ground to a fine consistency so it can dissolve easily. Step two: Get a small pan, just large enough to hold one or two cups of brewed coffee. Fill it with water and place it on the stove. Turn the burner on and set it to high. Step three: Wait until the water starts to boil. You can use the drip of your brewer by detaching it from your machine. Clean it first to remove any lingering coffee reside and then get your coffee mug and place the drip spout on the mug’s mouth. Step four: Take a disposable coffee filter and put it in the drip spout. Now, put the coffee grounds inn the drip spout. Use the desired measurement. It depends of course on how many cups of coffee you plan to make. If you want a strong cup of coffee, you can use three teaspoons of your favorite gourmet coffee. Tweak the measurements to your preferences as to the strength you prefer. Step five: Carefully remove the pan from the burner and then pour it slowly into the drip spout and coffee filter with the grounds. This will be similar to the brewing process you’d get by using your machine but without using so much electricity and wasting coffee. Step six: Once you’ve poured the water, and the grounds have been dissolved, you can add creamer and sugar to taste. The only difficult thing about this process is boiling the water to the desired temperature of one hundred ninety to two hundred five degrees Fahrenheit. Everything else is easy. Now you know that the next time your power goes out you can still make a deliciously refreshing cup of coffee brewed exactly to your taste. Enjoy!",000,1,Open Brew Coffee Without Coffee Maker,B07DBY4F95

The Squat Counter v3,"Welcome to the squat counter by Verve Health Coe. I'm here to help you get fitter and build stronger legs by doing more squats. Here you can set squat goals each week and keep track of how many squats you've done. Firstly, we'll set a goal for the week. And then each day, I'll ask you how many you've done that day. I'll provide you with a running total and let you know how long you have to reach your goal. To get the most out of this skill, I suggest adding it to a morning routine or night time routine, so you're reminded to tally your squats each day. Are you ready to set your first goal?",000,1,Yes,B085C53357
