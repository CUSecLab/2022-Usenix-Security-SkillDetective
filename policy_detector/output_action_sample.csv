Talk to Cricket expert,"Bowling, in cricket, is the action of propelling the ball toward the wicket defended by a batsman. A player skilled at bowling is called a bowler; a bowler who is also a competent batsman is known as an all-rounder. Bowling the ball is distinguished from throwing the ball by a strictly specified biomechanical definition, which restricts the angle of extension of the elbow. A single act of bowling the ball towards the batsman is called a ball or a delivery. Bowlers bowl deliveries in sets of six, called an over. Once a bowler has bowled an over, a teammate will bowl an over from the other end of the pitch. The Laws of Cricket govern…
Do yo want to learn pace or spin bowling?",000,1,learn pace,https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000b77d8f37e3
Talk to Cricket expert,"Other than the ability to land the ball on a strategically optimum line and length, the main weapons of the bowler are his ability to move the ball sideways as it approaches the batsman and his ability to deliver the ball at a high velocity.
The velocities of cricket bowlers vary between 40 and 100 mph (64 and 161 km/h). In professional cricket, a bowler in the 40–60 mph range would be said to be a slow bowler, in the 60–80 mph range a medium pace bowler, and a bowler 80 mph+ a fast bowler. In the amateur game, these distinctions would be approximately 10 mph slower. Many professional fast bowlers are able to reach speeds of over…
Would you like to learn swing bowling?",000,1,Yes,https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000b77d8f37e3
Talk to Cricket expert,"The essence of swing bowling is to get the cricket ball to deviate sideways as it moves through the air towards or away from the batsman. To do this, the bowler makes use of six factors:
The raised seam of the cricket ball
The angle of the seam to the direction of travel[1]
The wear and tear on the ball
The polishing liquid used on the ball
The speed of the delivery
The bowler's action
Outswinger: An outswinger to a right-handed batsman can be bowled by aligning the seam slightly to the left towards the slips and placing the roughened side of the ball on the left. To extract consistent swing, a bowler can also rotate his wrist toward the slips while keeping his arm straight. To a right-handed batsman, this results in the ball moving away to the off side while in flight, usually outwards from his body.
Inswinger: An inswinger to a right-handed batsman can be bowled by aligning the seam slightly to the right and placing the roughened side of the ball on the right. To extract consistent swing, a bowler can also…",000,1,Talk to Cricket expert,https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000b77d8f37e3

Talk to Cricket expert,"Although confusingly named a drive, the square drive is actually a horizontal bat shot, with identical arm mechanics to that of the square cut. The difference between the cut and the square drive is the height of the ball at contact: the cut is played to a ball bouncing waist high or above with the batsman standing tall, whereas the square drive is played to a wide ball of shin height with the batsman bending his knees and crouching low to make contact.

Talk to News Results from NBC Sports  College Football,"Here's the latest from CBS Sports, College football rankings: Ohio State jumps to No. 2, four SEC teams in top 10 of CBS Sports 127The CBS Sports 127 has been one week ahead of most polls and college football rankings -- not just this season but in general, though it did happen again seven days ago as Alabama was named the new No. 1 team in the country last week. The first-place votes had been getting shifted around between Alabama, Clemson and even Ohio State for a few weeks, and after the Crimson Tide blew out Mississippi State while Clemson needed a late rally to erase a double-digit halftime deficit against Boston College, enough votes changed hands to make the swap official. I sent that article and 2 others to your phone. Do you want me to read the first one?",000,1,Yes,https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/00000d7ccd32fb3d
